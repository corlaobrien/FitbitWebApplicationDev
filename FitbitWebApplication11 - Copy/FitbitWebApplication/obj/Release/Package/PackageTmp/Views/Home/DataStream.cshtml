            In relation to the heart rate data gathered, this is generated by the Fitbit device. Every time your heart beats, your capillaries expand and contract based on blood volume changes. It uses 
            PurePulse LED lights, which it reflects onto the skin, to detect theses blood volume changes. It then applies algorithms to measure heart rate automatically and continuously. This generated data 
            is stored on the tracker until it is connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth. This connection allows the tracker to sync data to the official Fitbit web service.

            Similarly, the Fitbit web service also receives data relating to step count. Each Fitbit wrist tracker uses a 3-axis accelerometer to track the user’s motions. An accelerometer is a device that
            turns movement into digital measurements when attached to the body. These digital measurements are stored on the tracker and algorithms are used to analysed the stored data to provide more
            detailed information about frequency, duration, intensity and patterns of movement. These patterns can determine steps taken, distance travelled, calories burned and sleep quality. Again, this
            data will sync to the Fitbit web service once the device is connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth.

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The data stored in the Fitbit web service will be used in this research project as a data source. The Fitbit Developer API provides an interface to collect the data relating to a single user.
